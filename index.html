        to <em>reduce cost and effort</em> <br />while maintaining a <em>minimum talent bar</em>.
      </p>
      <p>The result? <br />Great recruiting metrics, and an only okay team.</p>
      <p>That's backwards.</p>

      <p>
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/spredescu/">Sebastian Predescu</a> has been helping
        teams hire better for over 7 years. While at LinkedIn, he led hiring for a new organization
        as it scaled from 11 to 75 people in 3 years. On his departure, he was specifically asked to
        write down all that he knew about hiring top talent before he left, which led to the deck
        above. Since then, Sebastian has helped startups across several different industries apply these
        principles to transform their hiring motion.
